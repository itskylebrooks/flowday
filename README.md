  <p>A 20-second ritual that turns feelings into flowing visuals worth keeping and sharing.</p>

## Why Flowday?

Most journals want essays. Habit trackers reduce mood to numbers.  
**Flowday captures a visual memory thread in seconds:**

- Pick up to three emojis  
- Slide to a color  
- (Optional) Add a song title + artist  

From these tiny inputs, Flowday creates:

- Weekly flowing ribbons  
- Monthly continuous color mixes  
- Emoji constellations (your emotional sky)  
- Song Echoes (cassette-style snapshots)

No calendars. No streaks. Just ambient reflection.

## Principles

1. **Frictionless** – quicker than replying to a text.  
2. **Feels like art** – outputs look poster-ready by default.  
3. **Local-first** – entries stay on your device unless you opt in later.  
4. **Human tone** – playful, not clinical or gamified.

## Daily Flow

| Step | Action | Feedback |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Tap 1–3 emojis (triangle layout) | Empty slots invite filling |
| 2 | Drag rainbow slider (unlocked after first emoji) | Aura appears; label flips to “Saved 🌈” |
| 3 | (Optional) Add song | Becomes part of Echoes as a cassette |

Edits allowed for today & yesterday only. Earlier entries are snapshots.

## Visual Surfaces

**Today** – Emoji triangle + aura gradient, calm when saved, inviting when empty.  
**Flows** –  
- Week Flow: 7 blended bands in a soft wave  
- Month Mix: a luminous ribbon, continuous color without ticks  
Both exportable as minimal posters.  

**Constellations** – Top emojis become nodes; co-occurrences connect them. Motion suggests a night sky.  

**Echoes** – Days with songs show as cassette cards. Open one for spinning reels, date stamp, title & artist.

## Telegram Sync

Flowday integrates with Telegram Mini App for enhanced sharing and syncing. Your entries remain local by default, with optional cloud sync to keep your data safe and accessible across devices.

## Export & Import

You can export all your Flowday data to a file and import it back later. It's a simple way for web users to save and restore their entries—handy if you don't use Telegram sync. Your memories, your control.
